This is a github page for a group project from Universitas Indonesia's class of probability and stochastic for computer engineering major in 2018. 

This project is a reinterpretation of a paper titled "Stochastic model of short-term prediction of stock prices and its profitability in the Czech stock market" by Milan Svoboda
which abstract could be found [here]. But instead of using stock price that only could be found in Czech, we implement the formula to stock that could be found in Indonesia:
WSKT, UNVR, and INCO.
